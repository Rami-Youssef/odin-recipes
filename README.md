I m now kinda capable of using terminal and some of HTML commands without looking up anything, although i kinda lack some understanding of how git actually work.
I will try my best to finnish css and some of java in last 3 days , so i can move on to math and backend design next month.
There will always be room of improvement so i better keep going :D .
